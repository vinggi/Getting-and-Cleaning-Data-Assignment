This is the assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

First, download the dataset from this website:

Unzip the data file into your R working directory.

Second, load all the dataset into R (Train Dataset, Test Dataset, activity label, features).
For both training and testing dataset, extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Third, uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Lastly, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The second independent tidy data set is shown in the file TidySet.txt.
